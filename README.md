# Median Filter Denoising

This repository provides a Python implementation for applying median filters to noisy images using three different approaches: a naive method, a manual divide and conquer method, and a parallelized divide and conquer method. It includes performance comparisons and the calculation of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to evaluate the quality of the denoised images.
